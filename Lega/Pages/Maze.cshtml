<h1>Know Yourself</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://nl.wikibooks.org/wiki/Speels_leren/Maze">maze</a> is a game where we experience that learning is like a maze. Every time you think you're getting closer to the exit, there suddenly appears a fence in the way. More and more games and other software programs, such as search engines, have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> that gets to know you better as you use it. This way, the more you use the program, the more appropriate suggestions you get regarding passions and talents.</p>
<p>However, you hardly have any insight into how the AI does this and how well the AI knows you. For the AI, you are initially a maze too. Depending on the consistency (honesty) with which you make choices in the program and how complex you are as a person, the AI will gain more clarity and certainty about the path to follow. This is similar to getting less entangled in a maze.</p>

<p>If we represent this process in a maze; the position of the AI indicates how well it knows you, and the movement you can make shows which choice surprises the AI (gets further entangled in the maze) or confirms (brings closer to the exit), then you can visualize what the AI learns about you. And that gives insight into yourself. You could also symbolize this with credits or coins you collect.</p>

<p>What an AI does is essentially trying to answer questions about you. What is your favorite hobby, who do you prefer to contact, which items do you like the most, and so on. However, these questions are not asked directly but are inferred from our click choices and search queries, such as the Google AI. This is a missed opportunity to learn something about ourselves.</p>

<p>For playful learning, the questions will focus on someone's preferences for learning. This way, the AI can determine learning preferences and provide feedback. In this way, a familiar game, the maze, can be used to gain insight into your own learning style.</p>

<h2>Instructions to Incorporate the Unity Game from GitHub</h2>

<h3>1. Downloading the Repository:</h3>

<h3>3. Resolving Dependencies (if needed):</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Unity might prompt you about missing or outdated packages. If so, follow the on-screen instructions to resolve these issues.</li>
    <li>If there are any missing assets or scripts, you might need to re-link them in the Unity Editor.</li>
</ol>

<h3>4. Setting Up the Game Scene:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In the Unity Editor, navigate to the "Assets" panel.</li>
    <li>Look for the main game scene, which is usually named something like "MainScene" or "GameScene". If you're unsure, you can check the scenes available in the <code>Scenes</code> folder.</li>
    <li>Double-click on the main game scene to load it.</li>
</ol>

<h3>5. Compiling the Game:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Before compiling, ensure that the game runs correctly by clicking the "Play" button at the top center of the Unity Editor. If everything works as expected, you can proceed to the next step.</li>
    <li>To compile the game, go to "File" > "Build Settings".</li>
    <li>In the "Build Settings" window, ensure that your desired platform (e.g., Windows, Mac, etc.) is selected. If not, select your platform and click "Switch Platform".</li>
    <li>Click on "Add Open Scenes" to add the currently open scene to the build.</li>
    <li>Adjust any other settings as needed.</li>
    <li>Click on the "Build" button.</li>
    <li>Choose a location to save the compiled game and click "Save".</li>
    <li>Unity will then compile the game. Once done, you'll find the executable file in the location you chose.</li>
