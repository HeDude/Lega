    <h2>The Socratic Method</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to a journey of self-exploration, guided by the ancient wisdom of Socrates. The Socratic method, a hallmark of Western philosophy, is a process of questioning designed to expose contradictions in one's beliefs, encouraging the deep introspection needed to arrive at valid and universal truths. By engaging in this dialogue, you're embarking on a quest to better understand yourself and the world around you. Remember, as Socrates famously said, "The unexamined life is not worth living."
